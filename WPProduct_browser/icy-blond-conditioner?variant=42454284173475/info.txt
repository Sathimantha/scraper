Description:
specific conditioner for blonde hair
Formulated with a specific black pigment, it gives hair softness whilst counteracting yellow or orange tones in blonde or lightened hair, giving ash tones. Milk proteins restructure the hair deeply, giving hair a healthy, vibrant appearance.
Use: After cleansing with icy blond shampoo, apply evenly over damp hair, leave in for a few minutes, then rinse. For a more intense result, leave in for a few minutes more. The icy blond products contain pigments that can give a very intense result, especially on porous hair; once the desired result has been reached, alternate with a different conditioner to maintain the results.

Additional Information:
After cleansing, apply to damp hair and leave in for a few minutes, then rinse. For a more intense result, leave in for a few more minutes.
